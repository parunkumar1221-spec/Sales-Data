Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations

1. What It Means:
Sales trend analysis helps summarize sales over time to identify growth, decline, or seasonal patterns.

2. Common Aggregation Functions:
- SUM(): Total sales or quantity
- AVG(): Average sales
- COUNT(): Number of transactions
- MAX(): Highest sale
- MIN(): Lowest sale

3. Example Queries:

a) Daily Sales Trend:
SELECT date, SUM(sales) AS daily_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;

b) Monthly Sales Trend:
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m') AS month, SUM(sales) AS monthly_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;

c) Yearly Sales Trend:
SELECT YEAR(date) AS year, SUM(sales) AS yearly_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;

d) Average Daily Sales:
SELECT AVG(daily_sales) AS avg_daily_sales
FROM (
    SELECT date, SUM(sales) AS daily_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY date
) AS subquery;

e) Top 3 Months by Sales:
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(date, '%Y-%m') AS month, SUM(sales) AS monthly_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY monthly_sales DESC
LIMIT 3;

4. Visualization Ideas:
- Line chart: Sales over time
- Bar chart: Monthly or yearly sales totals
- Heatmap: Sales by month vs year
