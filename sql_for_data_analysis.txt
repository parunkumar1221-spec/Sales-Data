SQL for Data Analysis

1. What is SQL for Data Analysis?
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to:
- Retrieve data from databases
- Aggregate and summarize results
- Filter & sort information
- Combine multiple data sources
- Prepare data for visualization

2. Core SQL Commands
SELECT   - Pick columns
WHERE    - Filter rows
GROUP BY - Aggregate by category
ORDER BY - Sort results
JOIN     - Combine tables
HAVING   - Filter aggregated results
LIMIT    - Limit number of results

Example: SELECT product, sales FROM sales WHERE region = 'North';

3. Example Data Table (sales)
order_id | date       | region | category     | product   | sales | quantity | salesperson
1        | 2025-08-01| North  | Electronics  | Laptop    | 1500  | 2        | Anna Roy

4. Example Analysis Queries

a) Total Sales by Category
SELECT category, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

b) Top 5 Salespeople
SELECT salesperson, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY salesperson
ORDER BY total_sales DESC
LIMIT 5;

c) Sales Trends Over Time
SELECT date, SUM(sales) AS daily_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;

d) Regional Performance
SELECT region, SUM(sales) AS total_sales, COUNT(*) AS orders
FROM sales
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

e) Electronics Sales Only
SELECT date, SUM(sales) AS electronics_sales
FROM sales
WHERE category = 'Electronics'
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date;

5. How to Practice
